                    It’s nutty and aromatic, sometimes compared to Jasmine rice for that reason. If you want to make

                    days, widely available at stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, and even Walmart. It tastes earthy
                    and nutty. It contains antioxidants known as anthocyanins, which is what turns it a dark color (the
                    same antioxidant that’s in blueberries and blackberries).</p>

                    it originated in Thailand. It’s a shorter grain than basmati rice, but they can be used
                    interchangeably.</p>

                    potassium, while also offering more fiber per serving than white rice.</p>

                <p class="description">Parboiled rice is processed differently than regular white and brown rice.
                    The hull is left on as it’s soaked and steamed. It’s then dried, hulls are removed, and the
                    resulting rice is packaged. Because the hull is left on for longer in the process, the grains absorb
                    more nutrients like vitamin B and potassium. Once cooked, it’s dry and has a firm texture.</p>

                <p class="description">Sticky rice contains less amylose than other types of rice which causes the
                    grains to stick together cooked. It’s a sweet rice used in many Asian dishes, including desserts.
                    You can boil it or steam it, but you can also cook as you would risotto.</p>

                <p class="description">The classic white rice — long grain white rice is long and thin just as the
                    name implies, which also makes it fluffy once cooked. The shorter the rice, the more likely grains
                    are to stick together. The longer, the fluffier.</p>

                </a><br>
                <p class="description">Interestingly enough, wild isn’t actually rice. It just looks, cooks, and
                    acts like rice so it gets to borrow the name. Wild rice is actually made of seeds that come from a
                    type of marsh grass. It has more antioxidants than actual rice and may help improve heart health and
                    lower the risk of diabetes. Like long-grain white rice, it has a fluffy texture but tastes more
                    rustic and earthy. The photo pictured above is a mixture of wild and brown rice.</p>
